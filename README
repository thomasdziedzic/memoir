memoir is intended to be a minimal cli diary.

Usage:
Run memoir by typing 'm' into a terminal.
Type out your memoir, and it will write the entry to '~/.memoir' and exit as soon as an empty line is encountered.
If the first line is empty, it wont write the entry.
You can also send a SIGINT to exit the program without side effects.

Alternatively, you can run 'm' with any number of arguments.
Once you run 'm' with the arguments, it will automatically add a one line entry to '~/.memoir'.

Format of '~/.memoir':
date
entry
Entries are seperated by a line of dashes.

Dependencies:
python3
